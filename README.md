# Final Identity Grading Criteria.
Everyone that turned in the daily assignments and made any progress will be getting the 5 points for each. The final submission will be graded strictly by the below criteria.  I will be grading final submissions tomorrow.  Resubmissions will be permitted as per usual.
Paste the below list in your README and for each of the below items, add the requested information.

## ~~3 points - Create 2 different types of users~~

## 4 points - Attach at least 4 claims (including their Role) to the registration process.
Where can I find this?

## ~~4 points - Redirect the user, dependant on their role, to a specific page, upon login~~
Where and how can I test this?
* The home page redirects you to the admin page if you are an admin.

## ~~4 points (1 point for each CRUD operation) - Create a standard CRUD controller to manipulate data within your site.~~
How do I use your sites CRUD functionality?

## ~~3 points - Update your application to include at least 2 roles.~~
Where are they declared, where are they used?
* This entry is on the list twice.

## ~~3 points - Add at least one role based policy and one custom Authorization Handler policy to your application.~~
Where are they?
* The Admin page is only accessable to Admins, there's also a mostly complete policy that limits access to owners of a resource or admins. See the Authorization folder for related files.

## ~~3 points - Implement both of these policies in your site.~~
How are they used?
* The admin page is only accessable to admins, and the custom policy is applied to the edit and delete actions in the MCServersController.
